	// In order to assign debug names to Direct3D resources we need to use the "WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName"-GUID. This GUID
	// is defined within the "D3Dcommon.h" header and it's required to add the library "dxguid.lib" in which the symbol
	// is defined.
	// -> See "ID3D12Device::SetPrivateData method"-documentation at MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476533%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
	//    The "Community Additions" states: "If you get a missing symbol error: Note that WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName
	//    requires both that you include D3Dcommon.h, and that you link against dxguid.lib."
	// -> We don't want to deal with a 800 KB library "just" for such a tiny symbol for several reasons. For once it's not
	//    allowed to redistribute "dxguid.lib" due to DirectX SDK licensing terms. Another reason for avoiding libraries
	//    were ever possible is that every library will increase the complexity of the build system and will also make
	//    it harder to port to other platforms - we already would need 32 bit and 64 bit versions for standard Windows
	//    systems. We don't want that just for resolving a tiny symbol.
	//
	// "WKPDID_D3DDebugObjectName" is defined within the "D3Dcommon.h"-header as
