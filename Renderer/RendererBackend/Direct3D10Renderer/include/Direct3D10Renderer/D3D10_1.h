/*
  We don't use the Direct3D headers from the DirectX SDK because there are several issues:
  - Licensing: It's not allowed to redistribute the Direct3D headers, meaning everyone would
    have to get them somehow before compiling this project
  - The Direct3D headers are somewhat chaotic and include tons of other headers.
    This slows down compilation and the more headers are included, the higher the risk of
    naming or redefinition conflicts.
  - Starting with Windows 8, Direct3D is part of the Windows SDK. When using VisualStudio 2012
    and the Direct3D headers from "Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)" you will get a lot of
    "
      <path>\external\directx\include\dxgitype.h(12): warning C4005: 'DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED' : macro redefinition
      c:\program files (x86)\windows kits\8.0\include\shared\winerror.h(49449) : see previous definition of 'DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED'
    "
    warnings.

    Do not include this header within headers which are usually used by users as well, do only
    use it inside cpp-files. It must still be possible that users of this renderer interface
    can use the Direct3D headers for features not covered by this renderer interface.

    This header is included by "Cg/cgD3D10.h", redirect to the "Direct3D10Renderer/D3D10.h"-header
    so that we don't have to manipulate the Cg-header.
