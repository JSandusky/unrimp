/*
  We don't use the Direct3D headers from the DirectX SDK because there are several issues:
  - Licensing: It's not allowed to redistribute the Direct3D headers, meaning everyone would
    have to get them somehow before compiling this project
  - The Direct3D headers are somewhat chaotic and include tons of other headers.
    This slows down compilation and the more headers are included, the higher the risk of
    naming or redefinition conflicts.

    Do not include this header within headers which are usually used by users as well, do only
    use it inside cpp-files. It must still be possible that users of this renderer interface
    can use the Direct3D headers for features not covered by this renderer interface.
