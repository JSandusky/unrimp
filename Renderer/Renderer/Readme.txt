== Description ==
Renderer interfaces. Please note that this is a 100% interface project resulting in no binary at all. The one and only goal of this project is to offer unified renderer inferfaces for multiple graphics APIs like OpenGL or Direct3D. Features like resource loading, font rendering or even rendering of complex scenes is out of the scope of this project.

In order to make it easier to use the renderer, the optional comfort header "Renderer.h" puts everything together within a single header without any additional header inclusion. When writing interfaces for other languages like C# or Pascal, you might want to port this header instead of the more complex individual headers.


== Dependencies ==
None.


== Preprocessor Definitions ==
- Set "WIN32" as preprocessor definition when building for MS Windows
- Set "LINUX" as preprocessor definition when building for Linux or similar platforms
	- For Linux or similar platforms: Set "HAVE_VISIBILITY_ATTR" as preprocessor definition to use the visibility attribute (the used compiler must support it)
- Set "X64_ARCHITECTURE" as preprocessor definition when building for x64 instead of x86
- Set "RENDERER_NO_STATISTICS" as preprocessor definition in order to disable the gathering of statistics (it's recommended to only set this preprocessor definition if there are best possible performance requirements)
- Set "RENDERER_DEBUG" as preprocessor definition in order to enable e.g. Direct3D 9 PIX functions (D3DPERF_* functions, also works directly within VisualStudio 2012 out-of-the-box) debug features (disabling support just reduces the binary size slightly but makes debugging more difficult)
