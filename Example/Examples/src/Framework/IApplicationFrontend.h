	*  @remarks
	*    During runtime, the renderer toolkit can optionally be used to enable asset hot-reloading. Meaning,
	*    as soon as an source asset gets changed, the asset is recompiled in a background thread and the compiled
	*    runtime-ready asset is reloaded. One can see the change in realtime without the need to restart the application.
	*
	*    This feature links during runtime the renderer toolkit as soon as this method is accessed the first time. If
	*    the renderer toolkit shared library is not there, this method will return a null pointer. This is a developer-feature
	*    and as such, it's not available in static builds which are meant for the end-user who e.g. just want to "play the game".
