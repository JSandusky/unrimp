== Description ==
Standalone renderer project compiler example.


== Preprocessor Definitions ==
Other
- "WIN32":					Set as preprocessor definition when building for MS Windows
- "UNICODE":				Enable MS Windows command line Unicode support
- "LINUX":					Set as preprocessor definition when building for Linux or similar platforms
- "X64_ARCHITECTURE":		Set this as preprocessor definition when building for x64 instead of x86
- "SHARED_LIBRARIES":		Use renderers via shared libraries, if this is not defined, the renderers are statically linked
- "RENDERER_DEBUG":			Enable e.g. Direct3D 9 PIX functions (D3DPERF_* functions, also works directly within VisualStudio 2012 out-of-the-box) debug features (disabling support just reduces the binary size slightly but makes debugging more difficult)
- "RENDERER_NO_RUNTIME":	Disable renderer runtime support
